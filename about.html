                <p>If there’s one thing we’ve learnt over the past 75+ years, it’s that a better home creates a better life.
                   So we work to create better homes, every day, through the products and solutions we offer.
                   Our vision is to create a better everyday life for the many people.
                   On this site you can discover exactly what this means and find out who we are, what we do and what we stand for.
                   Every year since 2014 we’ve been connecting with people around the world to create our Life at Home Report.
                   So far, we’ve spoken to 105 738 of them.Finding the smartest, most innovative, cost-efficient way of doing things is part of our DNA. 
                   We’ve always gone our own way, knowing that you can’t blaze a trail by walking the same path as everyone else.</p>

                To create better homes, we need to know the challenges people are facing in their everyday lives.
                The world is changing, faster than ever before, and so are people’s needs and dreams.

                <h2>Sustainability – caring for people and the planet</h2>
                <p>To meet the challenges of unsustainable consumption, climate change, and growing inequality,

                   This means using more renewable and recycled materials, striving to eliminate waste in our operations and changing the way we design products.
                   We are also committed to regenerating resources, protecting ecosystems and improving biodiversity.
                   our company's value chain touches millions of people around the world. We are committed to respecting and supporting human rights throughout our value chain, championing the rights of children, decent work, and inclusive workplaces.
